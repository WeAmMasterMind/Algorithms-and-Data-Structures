# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms in C++. The goal is to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented code that can serve as a learning resource and reference for developers.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
- Trees (Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Red-Black, Segment, Trie)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Graph Traversal)
- Hash Tables
- Sets (HashSet, TreeSet)

### Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Radix)
- Searching (Linear, Binary, Jump, Interpolation, Exponential)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, Floyd-Warshall)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Fibonacci, Matrix Chain Multiplication)
- Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum)
- Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, Kruskal's, Prim's)
- Advanced Algorithms
  - Genetic Algorithms
  - Evolutionary Algorithms
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Ant Colony Optimization
  - Neural Networks (Basic Perceptron, Feedforward, Backpropagation)
