## Operations
- Print elements of the array.
- Insert an element at a specific position.
- Delete an element from a specific position.

## Files
- `arrays.cpp`: C++ implementation of an array.
- `arrays.py`: Python implementation of an array.

## How to Run

### C++
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ arrays.cpp -o arrays.exe
